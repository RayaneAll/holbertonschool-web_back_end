# Python - Async Comprehension

## Description
This project focuses on asynchronous programming in Python, specifically using asynchronous generators and comprehensions. You will learn how to write asynchronous generators, use async comprehensions, and measure runtime for parallel executions.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how to write asynchronous generators.
- Use async comprehensions to collect data from asynchronous generators.
- Measure runtime for parallel asynchronous executions.
- Type-annotate asynchronous generators and comprehensions.

## Requirements
- Python 3.9
- All files must be executable and end with a new line.
- Code must follow the `pycodestyle` style (version 2.5.x).
- All functions and coroutines must be type-annotated.
- All modules and functions must have proper documentation.
